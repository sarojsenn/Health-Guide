## Development Workflow

### 1. Local Development Setup

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Google Gemini API key
- Git for version control

#### Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
4. Create uploads directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir uploads
   ```

#### Running the Application
1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```
2. Open `frontend/index.html` in a browser or serve it locally
3. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Feature Development Process

#### Branching Strategy
- `main` branch: Production-ready code
- `develop` branch: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` branches: Individual feature development
- `hotfix/*` branches: Critical production fixes

#### Development Steps
1. Create feature branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
   ```

2. Implement feature:
   - Backend changes in `backend/server.js`
   - Frontend changes in `frontend/` files
   - Add tests in `backend/test_*.js` files

3. Test locally:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm test  # (when test scripts are added)
   node test_api.js
   node test_gemini.js
   ```

4. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: descriptive commit message"
   git push origin feature/new-feature-name
   ```

5. Create Pull Request to `develop` branch

### 3. Code Quality Standards

#### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Add input validation
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow RESTful API conventions

#### Frontend (Vanilla JS)
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Implement responsive design
- Add proper error handling for API calls
- Use semantic HTML
- Follow accessibility guidelines

#### General
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use consistent naming conventions

### 4. Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions
- Mock external dependencies (Gemini API)
- Test both success and error scenarios

#### Integration Tests
- Test API endpoints
- Test file upload functionality
- Test AI analysis pipeline

#### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete user workflows
- Test form submission and response
- Test error handling

### 5. Deployment Workflow

#### Staging Deployment
- Triggered on push to `develop` branch
- Deployed to staging environment
- Run automated tests
- Manual QA testing

#### Production Deployment
- Triggered on push to `main` branch
- Deploy to production environment
- Run health checks
- Monitor for issues

### 6. Environment Configuration

#### Development
- Local Node.js server
- Development Gemini API quota
- Local file uploads

#### Staging
- Staging server environment
- Staging Gemini API key
- Staging file storage

#### Production
- Production server environment
- Production Gemini API key
- Production file storage
- SSL certificates
- Domain configuration

### 7. Monitoring and Maintenance

#### Application Monitoring
- Server uptime monitoring
- API response time tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- File upload success rates

#### Security
- Regular dependency updates
- API key rotation
- File upload validation
- Input sanitization

#### Performance
- Database query optimization (when added)
- Image optimization
- Caching strategies
- CDN implementation

### 8. Troubleshooting Guide

#### Common Issues
1. **Gemini API errors**: Check API key and quota
2. **File upload failures**: Check uploads directory permissions
3. **CORS issues**: Verify frontend-backend communication
4. **Location detection**: Check browser permissions

#### Debugging Tools
- Browser developer console
- Node.js debugging
- API testing tools (Postman/Insomnia)
- Log analysis

### 9. Future Enhancements

#### Planned Features
- User authentication and profiles
- Historical report tracking
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Mobile app development
- Real-time notifications
- Integration with government databases

#### Technical Improvements
- Database implementation (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
- Caching layer (Redis)
- Containerization (Docker)
- Microservices architecture
- Advanced AI models for better analysis
